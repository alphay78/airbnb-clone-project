# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
The AirBnB Clone Project is a backend-focused application designed to replicate core features of Airbnb, providing a robust and scalable platform for managing users, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. The project emphasizes best practices in backend development, database optimization, API design, and application security, enabling learners to build a real-world, production-ready system.

## Project Goals

The AirBnB Clone project aims to build a robust and scalable backend platform that replicates key functionalities of Airbnb. The main goals are:

- **Secure User Management:** Implement registration, authentication, and profile management for guests and hosts.  
- **Efficient Property Management:** Allow hosts to create, update, and manage property listings.  
- **Seamless Booking System:** Enable users to reserve properties, manage bookings, and track check-in/check-out details.  
- **Reliable Payment Processing:** Handle transactions securely and record payment details accurately.  
- **Feedback and Review System:** Allow users to post ratings and reviews for properties, enhancing trust and transparency.  
- **Optimized Data Handling:** Ensure fast and efficient data retrieval through database design, indexing, and caching strategies.


## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer:**  
  Responsible for implementing API endpoints, writing business logic, and ensuring the backend supports all core functionalities such as user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

- **Database Administrator (DBA):**  
  Manages database design, schema creation, indexing, and optimizations to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **DevOps Engineer:**  
  Handles deployment, monitoring, scaling of backend services, and sets up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.

- **QA Engineer:**

## Technology Stack

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend and RESTful APIs. Provides rapid development and a clean, pragmatic design.  

- **Django REST Framework (DRF):** An extension of Django that simplifies the creation and management of RESTful APIs, including authentication, serialization, and CRUD operations.  

- **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, providing flexibility and efficiency in retrieving backend data.  

- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database system used to store and manage all project data, including users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.  

- **Celery:** A distributed task queue for handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments in the background.  

- **Redis:** An in-memory data store used for caching frequently accessed data and managing session information to improve performance.  

- **Docker:** A containerization platform used to create consistent development and deployment environments for the backend services.  

- **CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions):** Automated pipelines for testing, building, and deploying code changes efficiently while minimizing human error.

## Database Design

The AirBnB Clone project uses a relational database to manage users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews efficiently.

### **Entities and Key Fields**

1. **Users**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `username`
   - `email`
   - `password` (hashed)
   - `role` (guest, host, admin)  
   **Relationships:**  
   - A user can own multiple properties.  
   - A user can make multiple bookings.  
   - A user can post multiple reviews.

2. **Properties**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `title`
   - `description`
   - `location`
   - `price_per_night`
   - `owner_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
   **Relationships:**  
   - Each property belongs to one user (host).  
   - A property can have multiple bookings and reviews.

3. **Bookings**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
   - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
   - `check_in_date`
   - `check_out_date`  
   **Relationships:**  
   - Each booking belongs to one user and one property.  
   - A booking can have one payment.

4. **Payments**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings)
   - `amount`
   - `payment_method`
   - `status` (paid, pending)  
   **Relationships:**  
   - Each payment is linked to exactly one booking.

5. **Reviews**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
   - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
   - `rating` (1–5)
   - `comment`  
   **Relationships:**  
   - Each review is linked to one user and one property.

---

### **Entity Relationships Summary**
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**, make multiple **Bookings**, and post multiple **Reviews**.  
- A **Property** belongs to a **User** and can have multiple **Bookings** and **Reviews**.  
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**, and can have one **Payment**.  
- A **Payment** is associated with a single **Booking**.  
- A **Review** is linked to a single **User** and a single **Property**.

## Feature Breakdown

1. **User Management**  
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. This feature ensures secure access to the platform and allows users to interact with properties, bookings, and reviews based on their roles (guest or host).

2. **Property Management**  
Enables hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature allows the platform to maintain a catalog of available accommodations with relevant details such as location, price, and description.

3. **Booking System**  
Allows users to make, update, and manage reservations for properties. This feature ensures that users can select check-in and check-out dates, view availability, and track their bookings efficiently.

4. **Payment Processing**  
Manages payment transactions for bookings using various payment methods. This feature ensures secure handling of financial data and accurate recording of completed transactions.

5. **Review System**  
Enables users to leave ratings and comments on properties they have stayed in. This feature helps maintain transparency, provides feedback to hosts, and guides future users in choosing accommodations.

6. **Data Optimization**  
Implements indexing and caching strategies to improve database performance and reduce response times. This feature ensures the backend remains scalable and efficient under high user load.


## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect user data, ensure safe transactions, and maintain overall platform integrity. Key security measures for the AirBnB Clone project include:

- **Authentication**  
  Users must register and log in to access the platform. Authentication ensures that only verified users can perform actions like booking properties or posting reviews, protecting sensitive user information.

- **Authorization**  
  Role-based access control (guest, host, admin) restricts actions based on user permissions. For example, only hosts can create or update property listings, while guests can only make bookings or leave reviews.

- **Data Encryption**  
  Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information will be encrypted using industry-standard hashing and encryption algorithms. This protects data from unauthorized access or breaches.

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Limiting the number of requests per user/IP prevents abuse, brute-force attacks, and ensures stable API performance under high traffic.

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**  
  All inputs from users will be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common attacks.

- **Secure Payment Handling**  
  Payment transactions will follow secure protocols to protect financial data and ensure compliance with industry standards.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate testing, building, and deploying code changes. They are important for the project because they ensure reliable and consistent deployments, catch errors early, and streamline the development process.

Tools that could be used for this project include GitHub Actions and Docker.
